# How it works?
I have commented each line in the main.py file so please read that if you are intrested on the inner workings of this IP Grabber.

# How to prevent this?
Well it is very simple now this first of all is a python file there are a few ways to prevent this file.
* Read the source code:
If you review the source code you can clearly see what it executes and how this file works but if you haven't got common knowledge of python then this wouldn't be the best option.
* Read reviews on the file: If you haven't got a single clue then what you might wanna do is read comments if you got this file from a youtube video and see what they say or through the file through virustotal and see if anyone has commented on it their.
* There are other methods but ill add them soon.

# What if this got turned into a exe?
If the python file was turned into a exe from most of the py2exe files I have seen the always include a few other files so it will be very obvious they will also include py files but if I was you to stay safe I would never run a random exe.
